# Python Coding Examples

## Word use in Loan Applications
Using the Lending Club Loan Dataset, I begin by parsing words used in both "good" and "bad" loan applications. I then create a dictionary of the top 25 most frequently used words, which end up being very similar between both type of loans. I then identify the most frequent words uniquely used in each type of loan.
* Good loans: rate, !, it, lower
* Bad loans: bills, consolidation, need, help

## Sportrader Standing Table
Using the Sportradar Soccer v4 API to obtain data from the 2020-2021 season for the English Premier League, I create a standings table to organize match metrics for each team. The final standings table showcases:
* abbreviation of team name
* games played
* games won
* games drawn (ties)
* games lost
* goals for (total made)
* goals against (total conceded)
* goal difference
* total points

## Word use in Loan Applications
Using the Lending Club Loan Dataset, I begin by parsing words used in both "good" and "bad" loan applications. I then create a dictionary of the top 25 most frequently used words, which end up being very similar between both type of loans. I then identify the most frequent words uniquely used in each type of loan.
* Good loans: rate, !, it, lower
* Bad loans: bills, consolidation, need, help
